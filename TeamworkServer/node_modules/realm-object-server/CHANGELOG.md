## 2.0.7

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* Fixed several possible race conditions during server start and stop.

### Enhancements
* None

### Internals
* Introduces a timeout function which will race a regular promise. This is crucial for avoiding deadlocks in service requests.
* SyncProxyService now uses a shared cache of backend promises, creating less work when multiple connections for the same realm happen at the same time. Also avoids race conditions in this case.
* Introduced a RealmFactory class which can provide access to Realms on backend sync workers. This is now separated from the Server class.
* Introduced ServerState, which is used to prohibit request processing when a service is not completely ready. This avoids some race conditions, mostly during shutdown. Possible fix for #327.
* discovery.watchService will now fire an available event if the service is available when called. This simplifies a lot of situations where this is done by the caller.

### Enhancements
* None

### Internals
* Fix the flaky permission tests


## 2.0.0-rc.11

### Fixed Bugs

* Log level from command line is propagated to sync server.
* Public and private key from the command line are used by the server.


## 2.0.0-rc.10

### Enhancements

* Added register argument to server.getSyncedRealm. This ensures that the
  SyncedRealm is not persisted in the cache.

### Fixed Bugs

* Ensure that services that require SyncedRealms have all required data before
  serving requests


## 2.0.0.rc9

### Breaking changes

### Fixed bugs
* Fixed a situation where getting a userId could be null in updateOrCreateUserPermissionWithAdminPermission in PermissionsService

## 2.0.0.rc8

### Breaking changes

### Enhancements
* Also skip Email prompts if ROS_SKIP_PROMPTS environment var is set.

### Fixed bugs

* Mocha Test now run with compilers, however will need to remove in future.

### Internals

## 2.0.0.rc7

### Breaking changes
* Access tokens now have `sync_label` instead of `syncLabel` when in serialized
  form.

### Enhancements
* Added the agreement to license email step for the BasicServer

### Fixed bugs
* SyncProxyService: Fixed an issue when using sharded sync workers
* Fixed the issue when a synced realm used internally would be undefined or
  invalidated because of sync worker unavailability.

### Internals

* Changed the SyncedRealm class to return a Promise<Realm>. Once it resolves,
  the Realm is there, with valid syncSession which does not get destroyed when
  the sync worker fails over. It utilizes the new override_server() API to
  make the session reconnect to the new sync worker.
* Fixed all the other parts of ROS which use SyncedRealm. Some functions become
  async because of that.
* Changed the way the server starts and stops. Now there is no barrier between
  starting services and registering them. This is required, because now some
  services, in order to start, wait for the Sync service to register.
* Update JS to RC22 and Sync to 2.0.2
* Updated the schema for `/__wildcardpermissions` to match the `/~/__permission` Realms, using `userId = *` for these `Permission` objects.

## 2.0.0-rc.6

### Fixed bugs
* Fixed a bug in HTTPS support (sync proxy) [\#512](https://github.com/realm/ros/issues/512)


## 2.0.0-rc5

### Breaking changes

* Changed the password provider and PasswordRealm schema.
  The PasswordRealm now stores iterations, key length, and digest for each row.
* Changed the default digest from sha256 to sha512 in the password provider.

### Enhancements

* Add deleteUser to the AuthProvider API as an optional method.
* Implemented deleteUser for the password provider.
* Added provider User deletions to the AuthService.

### Fixed bugs

* "--loglevel all" was rejected. [\#500](https://github.com/realm/ros/issues/500)
* loglevel passed via CLI was ignored. [\#509](https://github.com/realm/ros/issues/509)
* Permission change by email now is processed correctly [\#508](https://github.com/realm/ros/issues/508) [\#426](https://github.com/realm/ros/issues/426)

### Internals

* Changed the default size of the salt length from 10,000 to 32 bytes.
* New unit tests for the password provider.
* Upgraded the migration script to take the new PasswordRealm schema into account.
* Adding name and reason when throwing InvalidParameters.
* Update JS to RC-20

### Enhancements

* Documentation for manual backup.

### Fixed bugs

* Permission changes now work properly when reducing privileges [\#438](https://github.com/realm/ros/issues/438)
* Changed the name of `__starpermissions` Realm to `__wildcardpermissions`. The object class
  name in it is now just `Permission` instead of `StarSpecificPermission`.
* All users now have read-only access to `__wildcardpermissions` on startup [\#431](https://github.com/realm/ros/issues/431)
* Grantor permission are reflected [\#491](https://github.com/realm/ros/issues/491) and [\#427](https://github.com/realm/ros/issues/427)
* If attempting to change permissions with a metadata value matching no users, an error is thrown instead of stalling forever.

### Internals

* Integration tests for user deletion.
* Lint clean up.
* Moved CLI functionality to BasicServer

## 2.0.0-rc2
